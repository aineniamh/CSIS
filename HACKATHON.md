# Hackathon

## Goals

1. Introduce automated tests for bioinformatic tools.
2. Educate ourselves in unit testing, continuous integration (CI), and YAML markup language.
3. Network with other bioinformaticians.
4. Create a community resource for identifying software that can pass unit tests.
5. Publish.

## Program

**NB: This is a tentative planning and might be subject to change.**

Tentative dates: December 2nd to 4th (Wed-Fri), 2020. ASM NGS will take place from 7 to 11 December (Mon-Fri).
We adhere to the same timezone as the ASM NGS conference itself, meaning the default timezone will be Eastern Standard Time (GMT -5:00).
However, we will try to organize the schedule in such a way that takes into account timezones of all participants.

The main program will be in Eastern Standard Time, but individual groups can work in local timezones.

### December 4th

## Teams

To stimulate interaction, we will subdivide participants into teams of 3-4 people.
Ideally, these teams will cover different levels of experience with Git, GitHub Actions, and software testing.
This way, every team can contribute to testing software.

To register your team, please edit and submit a pull request to [TEAMS.md](/TEAMS.md)

## Communication

All links to Discord and Zoom will be emailed separately to help avoid "Zoom bombing."

* We will use a Discord server, to be determined.
Each team will have a channel, named after their team.
Although Discord is encouraged, each team can decide if there is a different platform that they would like to set up for themselves.
* To communicate new pull requests, please start with a new issue in GitHub.
* The hackathon itself will be held over Zoom.
