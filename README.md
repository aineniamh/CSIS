# CSIS
:female-detective: Code Safety Inspection Service

## In short

Many bioinformatics projects do not use unit testing.
Without unit testing, it is difficult to ensure which bioinformatics software is in working order,
 or which bioinformatics software adheres to basic standards.
We are adding basic unit tests for bioinformatics software here using the GitHub Actions platform.

# Etymology

CSIS is a play on the acronym for the [United States Food Safety Inspection Service](https://www.fsis.usda.gov).
Additionally, it has CSI in the acronym (Crime Scene Investigation) which has a sort of detective feel to it.
